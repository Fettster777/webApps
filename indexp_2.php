		<h2>My Personal Web Space</h2>
		<p class="indented">

			Here you'll find a variety of information about me.&nbsp; 
			Of course, since this is a public page available through the 
			Worldwide Web, you can't count on the information being too personal 
			and/or very accurate; in other words (as quoted from <em>
			Dragnet</em>), some of the &quot;names have been changed to protect the 
			innocent.&quot;&nbsp;
			Hence, you'll likely find more correct data by going to the
			<a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> website!
		</p>
		<p class="indented">
			I was born in Nebraska and started playing video
			games when introduced to a Game Boy which I received for Christmas.&nbsp; I have only 1 sister.
			&nbsp; 
			I spent most of my childhood in Omaha, NE but moved to Arkansas in 2000.&nbsp; After graduating high school
			I decided to attend Arkansas State University.
		</p>
		<p class="indented">
			My father is an engineer and my mother is a retired teacher.&nbsp; 
		</p>
		<p class="indented">
			My fiance, Kirstyn Wyatt, is a Spanish teacher at Brookland Junior High.  We are getting married in December 2019. 
			
			Below is a picture of us in France in front of Notre Dame and a picture of us in front of Alc√°zar de Segovia in Spain.
